# SubT Challenge - Virtual Track HowTo

Here are instructions how to build, run locally and deploy to AWS "robotika" solution docker.
It is expected that you already have docker installed and your PC has compatible NVidia GPU.
For official instructions how to start with Docker please look at:
  https://bitbucket.org/osrf/subt/wiki/tutorials/SystemSetupDockerInstall


## Prepare OSGAR build environment
The convenience scripts for build and run are merged into OSGAR:
```
git clone https://github.com/robotika/osgar.git .
cd osgar
```

## Download official docker images
The currently available images are listed at:
  https://hub.docker.com/r/osrf/subt-virtual-testbed/tags
Note, that you will need cloudsim_sim_latest, cloudsim_bridge_latest and subt_solution_latest
```
docker pull osrf/subt-virtual-testbed:cloudsim_sim_latest
docker pull osrf/subt-virtual-testbed:cloudsim_bridge_latest
docker pull osrf/subt-virtual-testbed:subt_solution_latest
```

## Build and run locally simple unittest image
```
cd subt/docker
./build.bash unittest
./run.bash unittest
```

It is necessary to run also simulation and bridge in other two terminals:
- terminal 1
```
xhost +local:root
./run.bash osrf/subt-virtual-testbed:cloudsim_sim_latest cloudsim_sim.ign circuit:=urban worldName:=urban_circuit_practice_01 robotName1:=X0F200L robotConfig1:=X2_SENSOR_CONFIG_3
```
Note, that `xhost` workaround is not secure and it is current workaround how to start the process for the first time,
open screen session and then use the simulator remotely via ssh.

- terminal 2
```
./run.bash osrf/subt-virtual-testbed:cloudsim_bridge_latest circuit:=urban worldName:=urban_circuit_practice_01 robotName1:=X0F200L robotConfig1:=X2_SENSOR_CONFIG_3
```

Note, that configuration and robot name is variable. The command above with robot name X0F200L encodes waiting for 0 s,
exploring for 200 s and navigating along a wall on the left.
X2_SENSOR_CONFIG_3 is small robot, 30m lidar and QVGA camera. Use X2_SENSOR_CONFIG_4 for HD camera (better artifacts
but large logfile).

The unittest should display number of received messages for scan, image, imu, odometry and clock. After 10000 clock
messages it publishes `/subt/finish` causing end of session on AWS. Locally user has to stop it manually via Ctrl+C.

It is necessary to kill & start again both sim and bridge docker for each run. Note, that there exists "docker_compose"
solution not covered by this HOWTO.


## Build image for local testing
```
cd subt/docker
./build.bash sln_bash
./run.bash sln_bash
```

Now you are in the docker so you can update current OSGAR:
```
cd osgar
git pull
cd ..
osgar/subt/script/sync.sh
```
And run robotika solution code:
```
osgar/subt/docker/robotika/run_solution.bash
```

At this moment you should see waiting for ROS master, debug count outputs of received messages
(similarly as in unittest) and Python3 outputs of robot navigating towards the gate. The exploration reports
number and type of received messages by OSGAR.

There is a logfile available when the robot finishes. It is in the current directory with name zmq*.log
It is necessary to upload the logfile (for example via scp) to the base machine for further analysis, otherwise
it will be lost with the termination of the docker.

For update it is necessary to repeat all steps above within the docker. You can skip `sync.sh` if there are only
Python3 code changes. It is necessary to restart the docker to reset it to clean state.
