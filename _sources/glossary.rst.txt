.. glossary::

   bus
      The communication backbone, providing `publish` and `listen` operations.
      The bus takes care of sequencing all messages within the sysem and
      serialization via logging facility.

   driver
      Implementation of common nodes like TCP communication with outer world.

   link
      Directed connection of two nodes. The source node generates messages by
      `publish` call and the destinaion node accepts them via `listen` call.

   logfile
      Binary file containing message data with their source and timestamp.

   node
      The basic unit attached to `bus`. It has fixed set of inputs and outputs.

   OSGAR
      Open Source Garden/Generic Autonomous Robot (Python library)

   robot
      The collection of interacting `nodes` via `bus`. This typically corresponds
      to a machine with set of sensors and efectors in the real world.

   stream
      Output from node without specified destination like for `link`.    

   timestamp
      Python `datetime.timedelta` with microsecond precision starting from zero
      with the beginning of the program.
