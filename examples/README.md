SICK Robot Day 2018
-------------------

The German manufacture of LIDARs (laser scanner SICK) organizes every two years
competition in Waldkirch/Germany. The company provides testing samples of
sensors to participating universities. In 2018 it was TiM 571.

red metal balls. This example contains code used in the 2nd run, where Eduro
scored 3 balls and finished on the 3rd place in the competition.
